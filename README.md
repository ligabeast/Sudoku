## 1. Description 

Before i start to talk about something you dont even saw, lets first look the UI.

The UI offers three different difficulties (easy, medium, hard). Where the Difficulty is proportional to quantity of empty cells. By clicking of one of the difficulties a new Sudoku Field is generated.

Firstly you can see the time in minutes and the (remaining) quantity of empty cells. Next the UI has a numpad to set the values inside the cells (Select cell and than the number which should be set).

Last the UI has two Buttons (which speaks for itself) to generate a new field or solve the current Sudoku.

## 2. Used Technology

-C++ (Class Sudoku and Block is for the Backend, Class App and Mainframe is for the UI)

-For the frontend i choosed wxWidgets, which i do not recommend.
